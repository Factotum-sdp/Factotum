### Application Design



#### Name :

Factotum



#### Goal :

The main goal of that android application is to plan and record (localization, timing) the route of a courier (bike delivery) during an half-day period called a shift.


#### Fresh Ideas :

1. Font color to differs a manual entry edit from an automated one, and special color for the "boss" user
2. Modify order of the stack dynamically 
3. Notes specific on a line record 
4. Maybe add the manual destination entries of non-direct customer in the database at the end of each shift



#### Notes :
